# megahack-extension-rs
A simple MegaHack v6 extension template in Rust.

## How to use.
I explain how to edit it thoroughly within the doc comments. If you need extra help, message me on discord (alpha ary#0001). Just create a fork of the repo and compile it with:
`build --release`

You do need the config folder and such to run. I will add basic functionality inside the template, such as hooks.

**Feel free to give me suggestions!**


## Additions.
- [X] Most GUI implementations.
- [ ] Basic functionality.
- [ ] Important hooks and functions for GD coding.
- [ ] Automatic updates for absolutes extensions library.
