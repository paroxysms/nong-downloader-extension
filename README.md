# nong-downloader-extension
A simple MegaHack v6 extension that helps you download NONG songs directly to GD.


## Compiling.
Why would you **want** to compile?? I mean, if you do, this is how you do it _I guess_...

I explain how to edit it thoroughly within the doc comments. If you need extra help, message me on discord (alpha ary#0001). Just create a fork of the repo and compile it with:
`build --release`

It doesn't use any specific libraries or anything so you should be fine.

**Feel free to give me suggestions!**


## Additions.
- [X] Download from YouTube.
- [ ] Download from ~~Spotify~~ SoundCloud.
- [ ] Important hooks and functions for GD coding.
- [ ] Automatic updates for absolutes extensions library.
